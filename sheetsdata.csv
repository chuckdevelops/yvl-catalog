132 Total Full 114 OG File 2 Partial / Cut 22 Snippet 42 Unavailable,Die Lit,"(April 14, 2017) Playboi Carti releases ""Playboi Carti"" (May 11, 2018) Playboi Carti releases ""Die Lit""",,"Die Lit is the debut studio album by Playboi Carti and a big step in the sound he had been working on. After the success of his self-titled mixtape, Carti went even bigger, using catchy vocal styles and memorable hooks over spacey, hard-hitting beats from producers like Pi'erre Bourne, Maaly Raw, and Art Dealer. With a strong lineup of features, many consider Die Lit one of the best trap albums ever made. This album also marked the start of a change in Carti’s style. In the early days, his look and vibe were colorful and vibrant, matching the fun energy of his music. But with Die Lit, his image started shifting toward a darker, punk-inspired feel. This wasn’t just in fashion—it showed in his performances, visuals, and the way he carried himself as an artist. More than just an album, Die Lit helped set the stage for Whole Lotta Red. The wild energy, high-tempo beats, and chaotic feel of Die Lit paved the way for Carti to go even further. Whole Lotta Red would take these ideas to the next level, fully diving into punk energy, rougher beats, and a raw, aggressive sound that made it one of his most unique projects.",,,,,,,,,,,

He collaborated with Pi’erre Bourne, Richie Souf, and Maaly Raw, but after mixed reactions to the V2 sound, Carti scrapped and reworked the project before its final release. The cover art from this era comes from the @ MEH single, marking a transitional phase. Carti also underwent a major aesthetic transformation, dyeing his hair blonde, switching from freeform dreads to re-twists, and embracing avant-garde fashion, especially Rick Owens. The upside-down cross became central to his imagery, linking him to his Opium collective. Though initially divisive, the V2 sound is now regarded as a fan-favorite, with many tracks considered grails, marking this as one of his most experimental and influential phases.",,,,,,,,,,,

We know that Carti isn't a really good lyricist, but on certain tracks, he talks about the grief he experienced when Bigg Sosa passed and expresses how he copes on songs like 'ILoveUIHateU,' where he opens up about his drug addiction. Songs during this era have more of a somber, relaxed tone compared to the rest of his works, abandoning his baby-voice for an early version of what we know as his raspy voice. This shift was partly driven by the immense hate and criticism he received for the baby-voice, pushing him to explore a darker and more aggressive vocal style. Leakers say that there was a September version of Whole Lotta Red with a finalized tracklist, but we will probably never hear what this version of the album sounded like.",,,,,,,,,,,

The album was his biggest musical departure by far, forgoing most of the things that brought him success in the first place, such as production from Pi'erre Bourne, or features from popular collaborators like Lil Uzi Vert or A$AP Rocky. Instead, the album would only see a handful of features, and would see production predominantly from F1LTHY & Art Dealer. Connecting to V3, on this album Carti talks about his acts violence, expressing how he felt when Bigg Sosa died (grief to anger). On songs like On That Time, Stop Breathing and No Sl33p, he opens up on how he felt, displaying anger, sometimes sadness and vengence for his friend. Ye would be the executive producer for the album, and it would see a release on Christmas Day, 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,

However, both artists faced various problems and a shift in their sounds, leading to both albums being 'scrapped' for new content. In 2022, Uzi and Carti would begin their second attempts at releasing their albums, with Carti's album now titled 'Music'. Both would fail to drop their albums (however Uzi would release Red + White Tape with several grails and some new music), and an allegedly Kanye x Uzi x Carti tour was planned, but didn't go through (and not just because Kanye decided to go off on Jews). Starting in 2023, snippets and rumors would begin to circulate suggesting another iteration of 16*29 was in the works, but no one would really keep their hopes high. That was until Uzi posted a 16*29 teaser on his Instagram story, and when Pink Tape was finally released, Uzi would 'accidentally' release 'Pass it' featured Carti as 'Patience' on certain platforms. Unfortunately, it later came out Carti requested the song be taken off Pink Tape a few weeks before release, and despite some effort to get back on the album around Summer Smash, Uzi said no. Later, on September 13th, Carti would preview 'Vetements Jeans' nearly in full at a birthday event, leading many to speculate it would be released soon. Since then, Carti has finally started to release songs, but Uzi has yet to be featured.",,,,,,,,,,,

Carti's influence would be seen on NBA Youngboy's album ""I Rest My Case"" which was released in January of 2023 and was supposed to feature Carti, seemingly on the song ""Not My Friend"", but due to unknown circumstances he was taken off the album. Carti would then post a cryptic picture of Youngboy with an Opium chain in June of 2023, and then later on his team confirmed that a tape was on the way. Ken Carson has also confirmed the existence of the tape saying that he's been messing with Opium for a long time.

However, the album was never released, and a rumored version of it with tracks like ""PROBLEM CHILD"" and ""MOJO JOJO"" was scrapped. In September 2023, Carti held a disastrous pop-up concert for his birthday, where he performed ""VETEMENTS JEANS"" and ""PROBLEM CHILD."" In December, after nearly three years of promises, Carti announced I AM MUSIC, with tracks recorded in early December and features from Pharrell and Kanye West. He dropped his lead single ""Different Day"" in December and promoted a January 2024 release. But when January came, fans expected the album, only for Carti to delay it. He kept fans engaged with singles like ""BACKR00MS"" and ""EVILJ0RDAN,"" then featured on VULTURES 1. By March, after appearing on several tracks, Carti vanished, leaving fans confused and frustrated as insiders speculated he scrapped the album to perfect something new.

He resumed the I AM MUSIC rollout, confirming the album's 2024 release despite rumors of a delay. In September, he promoted the album with NBA-themed fit pics and an odd separate rollout for ""ALL RED"" on his birthday. He officially announced I AM MUSIC, but the pre-order description hinted at a potential 2025 release. He released the single ""Timeless"" with The Weeknd, amid controversy about his lack of involvement. He continued posting fit pics and announced a Rolling Loud performance, where he previewed 5 new songs, including ""CRUSH"" with Travis Scott. But after the show, Carti went silent again, leaving fans disappointed. As of February 2025, the album's release date remains unclear, with March 7th, 2025 as the latest rumored date. This version of I AM MUSIC focuses on sample-chop instrumentals and Kanye-inspired production, with a more refined whisper voice replacing the deep voice Carti used earlier. The album is influenced by the NARCISSIST era, but due to sample clearance issues, many of its ideas didn’t make it out in 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,Tracker Guidelines,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"1. Put Music Videos and everything unreleased that isn't a song, art, stems or a tracklist in misc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"2. When adding a new era (OR recoloring/renaming the era), use conditional formating (right click -> view more cell actions -> conditional formating). Else it won't work on the trackerhub app",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"3. To edit anything in Best Of, Special, Grails, Wanted, Worst Of, AI Ref Tracks, Recent, Recently Recorded or OG Files edit it in unreleased. Those sections work as filters filtering through the unreleased section (adding to it all the songs with the corresponding emoji or prerequisites such as Leak Date, File Date or OG File as an Available Length).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"4. Use music.froste.lol for all links, because krakenfiles links are deleted after some time. If something can't be uploaded to music.froste.lol due to large file size then use Mega. If it can't be uploaded due to file exension being outside music frostes range, use pillowcase or kraken.. Another site you can use is music.froste.lol, which is affiliated with the tracker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,5. Check if a song/mv/whatever is already added before you add it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,If you got any problems with the tracker or 'd like something changed u can dm me on .cx my @ is @Run4w or on discord @runaw. Also join the discord server for quicker response times.,,This tracker on the trackerhub app (fixed),,,,,,https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trackerhub.vercel.app/s/1rAU0sktd1GKpqo_AAWBtkXy10Px3BB_dnK9yJoN0umw&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1741822620074652&usg=AOvVaw3EOYEST5dvUhSeXgOG2vdK,,,,,

I AM MUSIC [V1],⭐ MÉNAGE [V2] (feat. Lil Uzi Vert) (prod. F1LTHY),"From 2023, the og file we got was fake. Before the song leaked, it was believed to be AI. A new CDQ snippet leaked on April 30, 2024, along with it becoming a GB option for $15,000. Force leaked the same day by Shogani. The version, that leaked is an edit. The real file has only 1:20 of vocals and open and this version has the previous vocals looped over the open instead, making it techincally just partially leaked, as the open is still unleaked. One of the biggest grails of the com before it leaked. The sessions for this song are in the hands of leakers, who say that the song was 'never finished' TLDR; we have all the vocals to the song, but the leaker just put the vocals from the first verse of the song over the open verse",2:51,"Apr 30, 2024","Jun 29, 2023",Unknown,Partial,CD Quality,https://pillowcase.su/f/778d59780ec7c1814d739cb2f18d6f5c,https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pillowcase.su/f/778d59780ec7c1814d739cb2f18d6f5c&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1741822619747126&usg=AOvVaw0isoX_PlDnZNemTgmnF1zE,,,,,
