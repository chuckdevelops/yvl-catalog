# React Integration Setup

We've set up a hybrid React+Django integration with these key components:

## Implemented Components

1. **Enhanced Audio Player**
   - Improved controls and features
   - Error handling with fallbacks
   - Visual feedback and styling
   - Located in `/catalog/static/catalog/js/react/audioPlayer.js`

2. **Badge Component**
   - Consistent badge styling throughout the application
   - Different variants and states
   - Removable badges for filtering
   - Located in `/catalog/static/catalog/js/react/components/Badge.js`

## Integration Method

We've chosen a non-invasive integration approach:
- Components mount in placeholder divs with data attributes
- React components enhance existing UI elements
- Server-side rendering still used for main page structure

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the React bundle**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   
   This creates JavaScript bundles in:
   `/catalog/static/catalog/js/dist/`

3. **Test the integration**:
   - Visit the song detail page to see the React audio player
   - Check that badges are rendering properly

4. **Future components to implement**:
   - Card View toggle for song list
   - AJAX filter system with dynamic updates
   - Mobile-optimized media player

## Development Workflow

During development:
- Run `npm run dev` to start webpack in watch mode
- Changes to React components will automatically rebuild
- Refresh the browser to see changes
