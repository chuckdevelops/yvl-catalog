# Audio Preview Playback Issue - Root Cause and Solution

## Root Cause Identified
After thorough investigation, the root cause of the audio preview playback issues has been identified:

**Low bitrate MP3 files are not properly playing in the browser**

Analysis shows:
- Working file: 18.77s, **128kbps**, 48.0kHz
- Problem files: 18.05s, **32kbps**, 44.1kHz

All problem files have an extremely low bitrate (32kbps) compared to the working file (128kbps). 
This appears to be causing browser compatibility issues.

## Solution
A script has been created to fix this issue:



The script will:
1. Create backups of all files
2. Convert low-bitrate files to 128kbps
3. Leave high-bitrate files unchanged

## Technical Details
- Low bitrate MP3 files (32kbps) appear to have compatibility issues in browsers
- The issue wasn't related to file duration as previously thought
- The extremely low bitrate likely results in incomplete/corrupted audio data that browsers have trouble decoding
- Converting to a standard bitrate (128kbps) resolves the issue
- All files have similar durations (~18s) but only the 128kbps file was playable

## Testing
The solution has been confirmed by:
1. Creating a test file with increased bitrate
2. Comparing playback between original and fixed versions
3. Verifying the fixed version plays correctly

This solution should provide a permanent fix without requiring any JavaScript workarounds.
