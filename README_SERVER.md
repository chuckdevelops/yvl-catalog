# Audio Preview Web Application

This application allows browsing and previewing audio files.

## Setup and Running

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server (with hot reloading):
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the production server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you have issues with the standard server, try the simple server:
```
npm run simple
```

Make sure the `dist` directory contains the built application files.

## Notes

- The application serves files from the `dist` directory
- Default port is 4173
- Check server logs for any errors during startup
